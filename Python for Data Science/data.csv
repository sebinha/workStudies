1;Almaden;10/22/2018 04:04 pm;;;;10;Very interesting and insightful experience. Fantastic speakers and host. Very impressed with company achievements. Thanks a lot for offering this opportunity! :-)
2;Almaden;10/19/2018 08:53 pm;;;;10;The tour was absolutely fascinating, I think the products IBM is producing are very interesting. Specifically, the debater project was fascinating to me.
3;Almaden;10/19/2018 08:40 am;;;;8;It gives insights from a leading corporation's view.
4;Almaden;10/19/2018 10:59 am;;;;10;Lecturer is experienced. They shared a lot of interesting information about AI.
5;Almaden;05/06/20 12:58;;;;10;NIL
6;Almaden;10/21/2018 03:24 pm;;;;9;The model for innovation that IBM practices is impressive and I believe is the true method for results: work with the community, enable passionate scientists and engineers to create.
7;Almaden;10/20/2018 10:09 am;;;;10;"I really enjoyed my time there. The presentation was nice and the building interior is beautiful. Getting the opportunity to hear from IBM senior management and senior copyright counsel was itself worth the score marked.
The presenters were enthusiastic about their fields and more than willing to answer any questions we might have had in a very intelligent and thoughtful manner."
8;Almaden;10/22/2018 07:23 am;;;;8;Presentation gave me a good sense of the size and scale at which IBM is approaching these big problems.
9;Almaden;10/22/2018 10:29 am;;;;9;Very informative. Extremely knowledgeable and and interesting hosts/speakers.
10;Almaden;10/22/2018 10:39 am;;;;9;I enjoyed the policy discussions we had and that the speakers tailored the discussion to what was relevant to our audience. I wish the conversation had included more of an immersive experience, maybe more about the technology of IBM. However, I do understand that most of this information is likely limited by confidentiality. Overall, great experience.
11;Almaden;10/22/2018 10:09 am;;;;7;Impressive past and current accomplishments, but the lack of diversity was disappointing.
12;Almaden;10/21/2018 01:42 am;;;;8;"very interesting insights into different areas; talks with various people working at IBM. Nevertheless, I would have loved to get a short tour of the buildings."
13;Almaden;10/21/2018 11:38 pm;;;;7;I wasn't not present for a fair majority of THINKLab to give a full assessment, but the speaker touched on some interesting points about IBM's history and business approach, such as, why IBM is no longer in the business of making computers.
14;Almaden;10/21/2018 10:30 pm;;;;7;Its the birthplace of some of the coolest tech in the world. Plus its an opportunity to meet some of the best minds in tech and learn from them
15;Almaden;10/19/2018 12:13 pm;;;;10;IBM is at the forefront of the latest technology. You get a glimpse of the latest technology when visiting the Lab. If you want to know what's new and hot, you should visit the Lab.
16;Almaden;10/19/2018 09:44 am;;;;10;Diversity of available resources
17;Almaden;10/22/2018 07:17 am;;;;10;The IBM personnel were fantastic in their presentations about IBM’s presence in the AI market and how they aim to help the world using AI.
18;Almaden;10/21/2018 06:13 pm;;;;0;I am a law student interested in criminal law so I am unlikely to have a colleague or business partner that the ThinkLab would be relevant to.
19;Almaden;05/23/2019 07:47 am;;;;9;"Very interesting introduction to Quantum computing and to the IBM offering
Very friendly staff.
We appreciated that senior IBM people took time to explain us what could be the/a future of computing"
20;Almaden;10/22/2018 11:00 am;;;;7;On reconsideration, I will likely recommend IBM research tools to colleagues. In criminal law, there is so many appeals and habeas corpus motions on so many issues, so a way to more intelligently go through the case law would be exceptionally helpful. If there is a version of the debate robot that works under the structure of a trial, having an AI to do mock trials with rather than pulling a colleague off their work to help with mock trials.

449;Yorktown;05/31/2019 06:06 pm;;;;8;Excellent presentations and speakers. Wish we had longer hands on lab visit. Wish a bit more balanced external market view.
450;Yorktown;03/08/18 12:16;Japan;Tokyo;13;9;The presentations were inspiring and really informative with regard to the overview of cutting-edge researches in IBM labs. I truly appreciate the opportunity. The only concern is that if you have researcher-level knowledge in a presented topic or have surveyed the field thoroughly in advance, the depth of content might not be sufficient as backgrounds of audiences could be somewhat diverse and the organizers and presenters would prepare content keeping such diversity in mind.
451;Yorktown;09/11/18 16:31;;;;10;Topics were relevant to our interests and goods. Great demos!
452;Yorktown;05/03/19 15:07;;;;9;Very impressive work on AI/ML especially commercial applications!
453;Yorktown;07/24/2019 03:41 pm;;;;10;Excellent overviews by IBM. We probably could have used more time at the end for open discussion and idea pitching.
454;Yorktown;07/24/2019 03:52 pm;;;;7;I've been a bit disappointed with the lack of much statistical perspective on the various scientific questions considered (there's been a lot of talk about AI and ML - not much on stats). It's hard to tell whether this is an opportunity or an impediment after just a lay long visit - time will tell!  In any case, we are grateful to IBM for the enormous effort they've put into our visit and I remain cautiously optimistic.
455;Yorktown;12/30/2019 05:04 pm;;;;9;I gained new insights in AI, Quantum Computing and how it will integrate in the future.
456;Yorktown;03/13/2018 04:03 pm;Japan;Tokyo;13;8;To feel the difference of East and West. I visited many labs around SF, at Yorktown lab I felt difference about philosophy, that was the main reason to recommend to visit there.
457;Yorktown;12/30/2019 05:44 pm;;;;8;Quite cool and interesting to see all the things IBM is evolving and defining the future of technology
458;Yorktown;05/13/2019 05:29 pm;;;;10;A lot of information about the latest technologies. At the same time very useful for our supply chain management and quality management.
459;Yorktown;08/29/2019 11:00 am;;;;8;Thank you very much for the interesting sessions.  I'd like to utilize AI, Quantum Computing into Maintenance first and then to Motion Planning in future.
460;Yorktown;08/29/2019 11:04 am;;;;8;"1. Concern-to be.  It did not give good impression for multiple troubles with projector system
2. Many good examples and it is obvious IBM has great technology - my concern is how to apply to our business other than Equip Maintenance - there are many possibilities
3. Concern is lack of real-world applications in similar industry.
4. Some presentation was very theoretical and went deep in underlying technology of AI - difficult to understand"
461;Yorktown;05/29/2019 04:45 pm;;;;10;IBM always shows us the future computer vision clearly from the hardware perspective!!!
462;Yorktown;05/29/2019 04:47 pm;;;;9;AI hardware research of IBM is quite impressive for our business applications.
463;Yorktown;05/03/19 22:51;;;;10;I am a high school student visiting during the Horizon conference (day 1 only) and absolutely loved the all the presentations I saw. I learned a lot during the conference, but the individual sessions were built in such a way that I was able to learn as the presentation went on, so although the material was getting more advanced towards the end of each session, it was built up, allowing me to understand. I also liked that IBM was to an extent dumbing down their research to make it easy for us and other corporate people to understand but still showcasing their research in a very positive light. As a student interested in entering research and academia, I would have loved to learn more about each project and have a less dumbed-down version, but I was really happy that it didn't all just go over my head.
464;Yorktown;11/28/2018 10:48 am;;;;8;Quantum! thank you.
465;Yorktown;03/25/2020 11:11 am;;;;8;Deep Search, AI-enriched simulation. Comments: Very informative and presented conclusively. Excited to try out tools available on-line plus finding applications to engage more  firmly on  Deep Search & AI-enriched simulation.

695;Yorktown;07/24/2019 03:27 pm;;;;9;Think lab is a fantastic facility which seems to be found only by imagination. While I'm sure that it is impossible to discuss in such a short time the breathe of research, I wish to have future talks on how to collaborate.
696;Yorktown;03/27/2019 06:38 pm;;;;9;Well organized. Each item was relevant and we finished on time.
697;Yorktown;12/30/2019 05:58 pm;;;;8;Perhaps some more real demos, instead of only powerpoint presentations - more lab stuff.
698;Yorktown;04/26/2018 08:03 am;;;;10;"As it related to our business relationship, my strategic interest in IBM has been the capabilities available through the company as opposed to any given product. THINKLab - and the researchers that drive the Lab - is an ideal way to showcase capability over product. I was very impressed by the talent and the demonstrations, with excellent discussion of the ""possible"" with a good blend of confidence and humility.  Looking forward to a long, successful relationship!"
699;Yorktown;05/02/18 16:26;;;;9;I found the access to the team, their research and the discussion productive and stimulating. I think they felt similar in that we had a bi-directional series of conversations where I contributed potential use cases.

726;Yorktown;10/29/2018 04:20 pm;;;;9;I could access the extremely valuable and important information which I don't see every day.  The integration of Financial world and IT has been discussed a lot recently and through this EST I strongly felt more and it was useful.  It would be more fruitful if I had adequate previous study.
727;Yorktown;01/21/2019 04:54 pm;;;;9;The thought and creativity of the entire leadership.
728;Yorktown;05/31/2019 06:18 pm;;;;9;It was a good opportunity to learn and actually see a Quantum computer in physical proximity.

749;Yorktown;01/16/2019 04:56 pm;;;;8;IBM technologies should be versatile.IBM will be able to create actual business use-case.
750;Yorktown;01/14/2019 04:33 pm;;;;9;Functionality of the rooms and hospitality of IBM Colleagues.
751;Yorktown;01/14/2019 04:53 pm;;;;10;Honest, clear, and inspiring. We could not think of any better approach.
752;Yorktown;09/24/2019 01:31 pm;;;;9;Very comprehensive information with great level of depth in the subject matter. Would suggest a tad higher level overview to some of the presentations to set the stage. IE: What part of the org are you from? Is this presentation research? Do you do this in an environment Watson only?
753;Yorktown;12/30/2019 01:49 pm;;;;10;"Adequate space to work & present comfortable. All staff very hospitable and meeting flow worked well. 
One recommendation is improve room temp control. Room felt cold at times."
754;Yorktown;12/30/2019 04:57 pm;;;;9;Very interesting topics. Nice to see IBM invest into humans future.
755;Yorktown;05/07/19 14:34;;;;9;Clearly the IBM Research Think Lab is on the cutting edge of Cyber Security issues and could bring value to their business partners.
756;Yorktown;10/15/2018 11:08 am;;;;10;Original, many things are worth learning from this visit. Lots of opportunities to collaborate.
757;Yorktown;10/15/2018 11:19 am;;;;7;AI and Blockchain.

A truly wonderful experience that was well worth our time. Already looking forward to getting back there. -- David L. Hoyt ""The Man Who Puzzles America"" www.DavidLHoyt.com"
763;Yorktown;10/23/2017 09:34 am;United States;Des Plaines;IL;8;Our experience was that the IBM team was very professional, engaging, and collaborative.
764;Yorktown;10/23/2017 07:36 pm;United States;Piscataway;NJ;8;I was invited by IBM to a Cognitive Event held on 10/17/2017 that was very good. I don't know exactly all that ThinkLab does.
765;Yorktown;10/26/2017 02:00 am;Sweden;Lund;27;10;Very inspiring and innovative.
766;Yorktown;10/26/2017 10:55 am;United States;Natick;MA;6;The scientific expertise at IBM Research is impressive and the effort to connect with industry is extremely commendable. I believe innovation happens at such interfaces. I am not sure if lectures of novel technologies is the ideal format to have a dialogue with the industry when looking for translatable applications. I suggest a format where problem statements are gathered from the industries of interest, problem statements are assessed and selected by IBM, and then brainstorming sessions are held to see how IBM technology can answer those problems. To be succinct, finding a solution for a problem may be more successful than finding a problem for a solution.
767;Yorktown;10/26/2017 12:07 pm;United States;Hercules;CA;10;great to see the work being done by IBM in the life science space and to consider how to apply it to real world problems
768;Yorktown;10/27/2017 08:41 pm;;;;10;Thorough and engaging coverage of topics
769;Yorktown;11/07/17 20:22;United States;Yorktown Heights;NY;8;I felt as if my tour of ibm was very informational about blockchain
770;Yorktown;11/08/17 07:26;United States;Bethel;CT;5;The entire tour was presentations.
771;Yorktown;11/08/17 07:46;United States;White Plains;NY;9;The presentations were very informative and at a good technical level for the audience.

774;Yorktown;11/12/17 04:46;United States;New York;NY;8;I don't know that many people in the vicinity of Yorktown.  I have met a young woman who's a scholarship winner from the EE program at CCNY and was job hunting to whom I recommended she explore IBM at Yorktown.  She seemed excited to hear that but hasn't gotten back to me.
775;Yorktown;11/13/2017 12:42 pm;United States;Yonkers;NY;10;The THINKLab was very informative. I learned a lot from the IBM employees there about the new technologies that are being worked on. The presentations were thorough and exciting.

780;Yorktown;04/15/2019 05:41 pm;;;;10;Brilliant research and accessible to all attendees. Exciting imagination. Keep up the good work.
781;Yorktown;09/17/2018 07:38 pm;;;;8;Because we had time constraint, there were some things I could not understand unfortunately. But, many specific examples/use cases were really helpful to get them right. I would like to know deeper how IBM sees aging infrastructures and how IBM can help us. In particular, business with local government). It was a really great opportunity. Thank you very much!
782;Yorktown;06/24/2019 02:53 pm;;;;10;Good research topics and focus.
783;Yorktown;09/24/2019 01:11 pm;;;;7;I think its a step in the right direction. IBM is building all the necessary building blocks and I think it will be good for companies to accelerate their efforts to monetize some of the ML work they are doing.
784;Yorktown;09/24/2019 01:15 pm;;;;8;Great day. Enjoyable to learn about what you're working on.

809;Yorktown;12/30/2019 06:03 pm;;;;8;This could be of interest to senior management. With this knowledge they could make a better long term IT plan for the company also where competitive advantage could be made.
810;Yorktown;11/06/18 16:08;;;;10;The depth of perspective.
811;Yorktown;03/27/2019 06:26 pm;;;;8;Nice facility.. Thanks for the hospitality. Quantum topic was great, many other good conversations. Some material could have been more at an executive level hence an 8.  Mesh was good.
812;Yorktown;08/05/19 15:04;;;;10;The event is really valuable! 1.5 days rather than 2 days in length would be convenient for clients outside of the US. Please consider this for the future events.
813;Yorktown;08/05/19 15:59;;;;10;Nice tour. Impressive people. Thanks for the bus from Wilmington!
814;Yorktown;10/19/2018 01:19 pm;;;;8;Comprehensive scope of capabilities. Lots of specific terminology relative to process/decision making that challenges the ability to follow at times.
815;Yorktown;12/30/2019 03:09 pm;;;;9;Very interesting use cases that illustrated the progression of IBM's AI capabilities.
816;Yorktown;03/27/2019 06:36 pm;;;;8;AR/VR were a little weak. All other updates were great.
817;Yorktown;11/06/18 15:57;;;;9;Very good informative session. Great learning & thinking opportunity.
818;Yorktown;08/16/2017 08:43 am;United States;New York;NY;9;IBM seems to be at the forefront of this new technology and has the experience and depth.

820;Yorktown;08/17/2017 04:58 pm;United States;New York;NY;9;Your colleagues made the experience a comfortable one - I was one of a few who had very limited knowledge of blockchain and felt confident participating despite. I think the session needed to have been a bit longer although I understand we may have given you time constraints.
821;Yorktown;08/22/2017 03:51 am;Europe;;;9;Brainstorm session was enticing the moderators were on point directing the conversation and helping find a solution

823;Yorktown;08/25/2017 09:00 pm;United States;New York;NY;9;It is very professional very advanced very high tech, easy to understand, easy to use, it learns about you the more you use it, the one thing i would change is variety in questions, for example, I don't understand something so I ask a question, but it doesn't understand my question and then it asks if I meant this question, which I did not mean that question. So my question is unanswered. I understand the developers are people writing these questions and writing an answer, but more variety would be nicer. Overall I enjoyed it. A lot of food, very cool things, etc.
